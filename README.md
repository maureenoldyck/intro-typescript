# TypeScript intro ‚å®Ô∏è 

## üìå Learning objective 

The goal of this exercise is not to know everything there is in TypeScript, but to give you an idea of what it can do.

## ‚ú® Mission 

* Install TypeScript globally on your system
* Use a config file, and adapt it so it will compile from your src folder to the public folder. Run tsc to compile the src JS file. Load the result from the public folder in the index.html.
* Time to look around in the TypeScript possibilities.
* Switch your source file to a TypeScript file. Since TypeScript behaves more strict than regular JavaScript, we'll need to adapt the code for it to work again. Check for any errors coming up and fix them.
* We've fixed the errors, is there more we can do? Let's make the best out of the typing system and add a type to all our variables. Lastly, what about the functions - anything we should adapt there?
* Usually, you will use Webpack to compile a bunch of things (the styling, for example) instead of just TypeScript. Move your application over to compile via webpack.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools 

* VSCode: Markdown, TypeScript, HTM
* NPM: Webpack
